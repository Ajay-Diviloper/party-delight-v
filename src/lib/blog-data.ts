    title: 'The Science Behind Perfect Pastry Dough',
    excerpt: 'Understanding the chemistry and techniques behind creating flaky, tender pastry dough that melts in your mouth.',
    content: `
      <p>Creating perfect pastry dough is both an art and a science. Understanding the chemical reactions and physical processes involved can help you achieve consistent, professional results.</p>
      
      <h2>The Role of Fat in Pastry</h2>
      <p>Fat, whether butter, shortening, or lard, plays a crucial role in creating flaky layers. The fat coats flour particles, preventing gluten formation and creating the characteristic flaky texture.</p>
      
      <h2>Temperature Control</h2>
      <p>Temperature is critical in pastry making. Cold ingredients and equipment help maintain the fat's solid state, ensuring proper layering and preventing the dough from becoming tough.</p>
      
      <h2>Gluten Development</h2>
      <p>Minimal gluten development is key to tender pastry. Over-mixing or using too much water can lead to tough, chewy results instead of the desired flaky texture.</p>
      
      <h2>Resting and Chilling</h2>
      <p>Allowing the dough to rest and chill between steps is essential. This relaxes the gluten, firms up the fat, and makes the dough easier to work with.</p>
      
      <p>Mastering pastry dough takes practice and patience, but understanding the science behind it will help you troubleshoot and improve your results.</p>
